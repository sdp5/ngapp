## ToDo / Improvements List

#### User Experience
Application layout, buttons, icons are all consistent as they belong to single toolkit: material. Navigations and placements of components are also meaningful. Though UI can be improved a lot for devices, it can manage to get 6/10 kind of rating. Some features are yet to get integrated well, which certainly shall boost this!

#### Aesthetics
Theme setting for entire app gives a consistent look and colors to components no matter which page/component they belong to. It makes development and maintenance of styles easy too.

#### Scalability
Components based structure makes it scalable. Each component can grow independently. Firestore APIs makes it really capable of handling large number of users at a time. Seperation of list, edit and userservice helps keeping each operation sustainable even at high usage.


#### Improvements
 * Login Component
    * `Invalid Email/Password` error message
 * Some more UI polishing, Mobile responsive
 * Code cleanup
